# Map3 Assets

Map3 helps developers integrate more crypto assets into their products. 

Our API packages the metadata necessary to build great products that span multiple crypto networks. This data is verified through an on-chain verification protocol, making it trustless.

You can think of us like [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) for Web3. 

## Project Status
Map3 contains accurate metadata for 27 networks and close to 8000 assets. We are working on streamline our process in order for community members to add, verify and map more assets. We are also working on scaling our Kleros-based verification process. 

You can already start consuming the data in the repository by signing up for the API at https://map3.xyz. 

## Overview

### 1. Cross-chain Index
Build crypto products that leverage rich assets & networks metadata for the top blockchains including vectors, contracts, i18n, identifiers, regexes and other semantic data. All the data is hosted on Github and is Open Source.  

### 2. Trustless Verifications
Any one can add data and verify it through an on-chain collateralised assertions protocol. This enables you to map and group assets across networks without having to do manual the work.

### 3. Self-hostable APIs
We understand that your systems need the assets & networks metadata to be highly available, secure and instantly accessible. Our self-hostable APIs use local caching and automatic refresh to give you the lowest latency.
